# CloudMalwareAlarm
This project aims to search for malware and malicious files on Cloud Environments using Distributed Computing such as Hadoop

As described in the image below, this project consists of three modules: Client, Cloud Storage, and Hadoop. The first simulates an environment where users send their files to the cloud provider -- in this case, to the Cloud Storage Module. The Cloud Storage Module is responsible for receiving files from users as well as to storage these files. Finally, the Hadoop Module, the most import, is responsible for searching for malicious files through its mappers and reducers, which work as filters.
